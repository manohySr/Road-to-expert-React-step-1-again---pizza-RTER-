# THIS IS PART OF RELEARNING REACT PROJECT

# Pizza Menu - React Learning Project

This project is part of my self-directed journey to relearn React, using freely available resources from [Jonas Schmedtmann's Ultimate React Course GitHub repository](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/ultimate-react-course).

## About This Project

This is a Pizza Menu application that I'm building to practice React fundamentals.

## Learning Approach

**Note:** I have not purchased the Udemy course. Instead, I'm:

1. **Studying the GitHub materials**: Jonas Schmedtmann has generously made the project code publicly available
2. **Using LLMs**: Getting help from AI assistants to understand concepts and debug issues
3. **Hands-on coding**: Recreating the projects myself to learn by doing
4. **Self-directed learning**: Building my understanding through practice and experimentation

## Purpose

- **Relearn React**: Refresh and strengthen my React knowledge
- **Practice-based Learning**: Build real projects to understand React concepts
- **Resource Utilization**: Make the most of freely available materials and modern learning tools

## Course Reference

This project follows examples from:

- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/ultimate-react-course
- **Original Course**: The Ultimate React Course (Udemy) by Jonas Schmedtmann
- **Learning Method**: Self-study using open-source materials, LLMs, and personal coding practice

## Learning Focus

This pizza menu project helps me practice:

- React components
- JSX syntax
- Props and state
- Component composition
- Basic React patterns

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to Jonas Schmedtmann for making the course materials available on GitHub, enabling self-learners to study React through practical examples.
